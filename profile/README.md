> ### 🪄 A new redesigned and open learning platform to broadcast the most advanced collective intelligence educational system

### 🍎 What is 01 Edu, and how does it differ from other educational platforms?

We are excited to introduce our redesigned and open learning platform, 01 Edu System, which aims to bring the most advanced collective intelligence educational system to the world. Our innovative curriculum in software engineering and programming is designed for learners who want to develop their skills in the digital world and technology industry.

Unlike traditional teaching methods, our platform is built on a collective and co-creative learning process in a professional environment. We have learned from the successes of existing projects like Epita, Epitech, Web Academy, and 42 School to create a platform that is scalable, learner-friendly, flexible, open, versatile, and technologically up-to-date.

Thank you for choosing 01 Edu, and we look forward to helping you achieve your educational and career goals. Happy learning!
